This project is focused on detecting webshells, which are malicious scripts or files uploaded to web servers by attackers to gain remote access or control over the server.
The detection system uses machine learning and/or signature-based techniques to identify suspicious files and prevent exploitation.

Static Analysis: Signature-based detection using YARA rules, file hashes, etc.
Machine Learning Models: Classification algorithms to distinguish between benign and malicious files
Feature Extraction: Extracts suspicious keywords, file entropy, code structure, etc.
Visualization: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) of the dataset for better understanding
Automation: Scripts to automate detection against batches of files or folders

Dataset
Benign Files: Clean PHP, ASP, JSP scripts
Malicious Files: Known webshells collected from threat intelligence repositories
Dataset preprocessing steps are explained in notebooks/data_preprocessing.ipynb

Model Info
Algorithms used: (e.g., RandomForest, XGBoost, SVM, etc.)
Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
Results available in results/ directory

Security Note
This project is for educational and research purposes only.
Do not deploy without appropriate review in real-world systems.
